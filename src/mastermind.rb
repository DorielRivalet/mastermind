# Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code,
# starting with you guessing the computerâ€™s random code.

# Think about how you would set this problem up!
# Build the game assuming the computer randomly selects the secret colors and the human player must guess them. 
# Remember that you need to give the proper feedback on how good the guess was each turn!
# Now refactor your code to allow the human player to choose whether they want to be the creator of the secret code or the guesser.

# Build it out so that the computer will guess  you decide to choose your own secret colors. 
# You may choose to implement a computer strategy that follows the rules of the game or you can modify these rules.

# If you choose to modify the rules, you can provide the computer additional information about each guess.

# For example, you can start by having the computer guess randomly, but keep the ones that match exactly.

# You can add a little bit more intelligence to the computer player so that,  the computer has guessed the right color but the wrong position,
# its next guess will need to include that color somewhere.

# If you want to follow the rules of the game, youâ€™ll need to research strategies for solving Mastermind, such as this post.

# Post your solution below!

# A simple strategy which is good and computationally much faster than Knuth's is the following (I have programmed both)

# Create the list 1111,...,6666 of all candidate secret codes

# Start with 1122.

# Repeat the following 2 steps:

# 1) After you got the answer (number of red and number of white pegs) eliminate from the list of candidates 
# all codes that would not have produced the same answer  they were the secret code.

# 2) Pick the first element in the list and use it as new guess.

# This averages no more than 5 guesses.

# This is the Swaszek (1999-2000) strategy that was mentioned in another answer.
